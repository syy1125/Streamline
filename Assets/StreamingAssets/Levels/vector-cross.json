  "Name": "Vector Cross Product",
  "Description": [
    "Vector cross product is often used in mathematics to help determine the relationship between two vectors.",
    "The cross product is defined as <x1, y1, z1> ✕ <x2, y2, z2> = <y1*z2 - y2*z1, z1*x2 - z2*x1, x1*y2 - x2*y1>."
  ],
  "Objective": [
    "The cross product is defined as <x1, y1, z1> ✕ <x2, y2, z2> = <y1*z2 - y2*z1, z1*x2 - z2*x1, x1*y2 - x2*y1>.",
    "The values from input 1 will be x1, y1, z1, and then 0 afterwards. The values from input 2 will be x2, y2, z2, and then 0 afterwards.",
    "Send the output in the order of x, y, z to output 1."
